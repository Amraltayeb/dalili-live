## ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Professional Foundation & Homepage Rework (COMPLETE)**

This foundational phase was critical to transforming the project from a simple static page into a scalable, dynamic, and professional web application. All objectives in this phase have been met.

### **Key Achievements:**

#### **1. Backend & Database Architecture:**
-   **Dynamic Database Schema:** Implemented a full database schema in `lib/sql/database_setup.sql` for `categories`, `businesses`, `tags`, and `business_tags`.
-   **Semantic Search Function:** Created the `search_businesses` PostgreSQL function to enable intelligent, tag-based searching (e.g., searching "car tires" can find a "mechanic").
-   **Full Data Access Layer:** The `lib/supabase.js` file now contains a complete set of helper functions for all database operations (CRUD for businesses, categories, etc.), providing a clean API for the frontend.

#### **2. Frontend & UI/UX:**
-   **Dynamic Homepage:** The main page (`src/app/page.tsx`) is now fully dynamic.
    -   The "Categories" section is rendered from the database.
    -   The "Featured Businesses" section displays real data.
-   **Modern Search Interface:** A professional, Yelp-style two-part search bar has been implemented.
-   **Robust Component Structure:** The frontend code was refactored to use strict, database-aligned TypeScript types, ensuring code stability and maintainability.
-   **Polished Design:** The UI for categories and business cards has been significantly improved to be more modern and visually appealing.

#### **3. Technical & Project Health:**
-   **Clean Codebase:** Resolved all outstanding linter errors and configured `tsconfig.json` with correct path aliases (`@/lib/*`).
-   **Organized Project Structure:** Established clear boundaries for code vs. documentation, ensuring that `00_AI_PRIORITY_DOCS` is used exclusively for planning.
-   **Professional Workflow:** Solidified the **Plan, Confirm, Execute (PCE)** model as our primary development protocol.

## ‚û°Ô∏è **Phase 2: The Search Experience (Current Focus)**

With the foundation in place, our next priority is to make the search functionality fully operational. This phase will bring our semantic search backend to life for the user.

### **Action Plan:**

1.  **Create the Search Results Page:**
    -   Create a new page route at `src/app/search/page.tsx`.
    -   This page will be responsible for displaying the results of a user's search.

2.  **Implement Search Navigation:**
    -   Update the `handleSearch` function in `src/app/page.tsx`.
    -   Instead of logging to the console, it will use the Next.js `useRouter` hook to navigate to the new search page, passing the search query and location as URL parameters (e.g., `/search?q=car%20wash&location=El%20Shorouk`).

3.  **Fetch & Display Search Results:**
    -   On the `search/page.tsx`, read the query and location from the URL parameters using `useSearchParams`.
    -   Call the `getBusinesses` function from `lib/supabase.js`, passing the search term to the `{ search: '...' }` filter, which will in turn use our `search_businesses` SQL function.
    -   Design and build the UI to display the list of resulting businesses.

4.  **Implement Filtering & Sorting (Stretch Goal):**
    -   Add UI controls on the search results page to allow users to filter by category, rating, etc.
    -   Add options to sort results by relevance, rating, or date added.

## üöÄ **Phase 3: Business & User Features (Future Work)**

Once the core search experience is complete and robust, we will move on to building out features that enrich the platform for both consumers and business owners.

### **Potential Features:**

-   **Detailed Business Pages:** Create individual, dynamic pages for each business at a route like `/business/[id]`.
-   **User Reviews & Ratings:** Build a system for users to submit, view, and edit reviews and ratings for businesses.
-   **User Accounts:** Implement user authentication and profiles.
-   **Business Owner Dashboard:** A secure area for business owners to claim and manage their listings, respond to reviews, and view analytics.
-   **Map View:** Integrate a map to show business locations visually.
