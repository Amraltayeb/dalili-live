# Dalili Business Directory

A modern business directory application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

## 📍 Current Status: Deployment Blocked

The application's codebase is complete and all known bugs have been fixed. The project has been successfully migrated to the Next.js App Router, the data access layer has been refactored, and the database schema is robust.

However, the final deployment to Vercel is failing.

### 🛑 The Final Problem: Vercel Cannot Connect to Supabase

During the Vercel build process, the application fails at the static page generation step with a `TypeError: fetch failed`.

- **This is not a code issue.** All local and Vercel-specific code and configuration bugs have been resolved.
- **This is not a Vercel Environment Variable issue.** The `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` variables are now correctly configured in the Vercel project settings.

This error indicates that Vercel's servers are being actively blocked from connecting to your Supabase database.

## 🚀 Your Next Steps: Fix Supabase Settings

To fix this, you must check the settings in your Supabase project dashboard.

**Please perform the following two checks:**

1.  **✅ Check if the Project is Paused**
    - Go to your main project dashboard on Supabase.
    - If the project is paused due to inactivity, please **resume it**.

2.  **✅ Check Network Restrictions**
    - In your Supabase project, navigate to **Settings > Database**.
    - Scroll down to the **Network Restrictions** section.
    - Ensure there are no IP addresses listed, or that Vercel's IP ranges are allowed. For debugging, it is safest to **remove all restrictions** to allow connections from any IP.

After verifying that the project is active and that network restrictions are not blocking Vercel, trigger a new deployment in your Vercel dashboard. This should resolve the final issue and allow the project to go live.

## ✅ Key Achievements & Refactoring

- **Architectural Shift:** Migrated the entire application from the legacy Next.js Pages Router to the modern App Router.
- **Data Access Layer:** Replaced the legacy `lib/supabase.js` with a robust data access layer in `lib/dal.ts`.
- **Database Schema:** Redesigned the database from a simple parent-child category model to a flexible many-to-many relationship using a `category_tags` join table.
- **Dynamic Homepage:** Converted the main page (`src/app/page.tsx`) to a Server Component that fetches data directly.
- **Component Refactoring:** Extracted the interactive search bar into its own Client Component.
- **Git Hygiene:** Cleaned the repository history by removing tracked `node_modules` and `.next` directories.
- **Vercel Configuration:** Identified and fixed multiple issues with environment variables in the Vercel deployment settings.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory (Windows PowerShell)
cd "DALILI PROJECT"

# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test the application
start http://localhost:3000/simple-test   # ✅ Should work
start http://localhost:3000/home-no-db    # ✅ Should work (beautiful UI)
start http://localhost:3000               # ❌ Supabase connection issue
```

## 🔍 Current Status

### ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY:**
- **Next.js Application** - Routing, compilation, UI
- **Tailwind CSS** - All styling and responsive design
- **Environment Variables** - Correctly loaded
- **Database Content** - 24 businesses, 10 categories, 3 areas
- **Supabase Project** - Active and healthy (verified in dashboard)
- **Internationalization** - Arabic, English, French support

### ❌ **SINGLE ISSUE:**
- **Database Connection** - "TypeError: Failed to fetch"
- Both Supabase client AND direct API calls fail
- Network/security related (not code issue)

## 🎯 What's Built

- **📱 Beautiful Home Page** with search and filters
- **🏪 Business Detail Pages** with contact integration  
- **👨‍💼 Admin Panel** for business management
- **🔍 Real-time Search** by name and category
- **📊 Statistics Dashboard** 
- **📱 WhatsApp/Phone Integration**
- **🧪 Comprehensive Debugging Tools**
- **🌐 Multi-language Support** (AR/EN/FR)

## 🗃️ Database

**Supabase Project:** https://jqnwrzfhzzktrvlzjpyj.supabase.co

- **24 Businesses** across 3 areas
- **10 Categories** with Arabic names
- **3 Sample Users** (admin/owner/customer)
- **Complete Schema** ready for production

## 🔧 Environment Setup

The `.env.local` file is already configured with:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://jqnwrzfhzzktrvlzjpyj.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImpxbndyemZoenprInJ2bHpqcHlqIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzEwOTQ1NjIsImV4cCI6MjA0NjY3MDU2Mn0.tWKd4yDCJ90gL3N5GnEZH4zWDSa-AHYJww1P9vK9FNM
```

## 🧪 Debug Pages

- `/simple-test` - Basic Next.js test (✅ Works)
- `/home-no-db` - UI without database (✅ Works)
- `/debug-supabase` - Connection diagnostics
- `/direct-test` - Direct API test

## 🔥 Quick Fix Needed

**Test this URL in browser to verify API access:**
```
https://jqnwrzfhzzktrvlzjpyj.supabase.co/rest/v1/categories?select=*&apikey=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImpxbndyemZoenprInJ2bHpqcHlqIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzEwOTQ1NjIsImV4cCI6MjA0NjY3MDU2Mn0.tWKd4yDCJ90gL3N5GnEZH4zWDSa-AHYJww1P9vK9FNM
```

If this works in browser but fails in app:
- Check Windows Defender/Firewall
- Try different network (mobile hotspot)
- Update Supabase client: `npm update @supabase/supabase-js`
