Welcome to the DALILI project! This is a modern, community-driven business directory platform built with Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to discover, review, and submit local businesses. The platform is designed to be a Progressive Web App (PWA), offering a seamless, installable experience on any device.

## Project Status & Achievements (As of June 2024)

Over the past sessions, we have successfully built and deployed a feature-rich, fully functional application. Here is a summary of our key achievements:

### 1. **Core Infrastructure & Database**
- **Database Schema**: Designed and implemented a robust database schema in Supabase with tables for businesses, categories, reviews, user profiles, and business submissions.
- **User Authentication**: Full user authentication system including secure login, signup, and profile management.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented a user roles system (`user` and `admin`) to manage permissions across the application.

### 2. **User-Facing Features**
- **Business Discovery**: Users can browse and search for businesses, filter by category, and view detailed business pages.
- **Dynamic Business Pages**: Business pages are rich with information, including an interactive photo gallery, dynamic business hours, amenities, and live user reviews.
- **Business & Review Submissions**: Registered users can submit new businesses and write reviews, including a star rating and photo uploads.
- **Responsive UI**: The entire user interface is modern, responsive, and built with Tailwind CSS for a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 3. **Admin & Moderation**
- **Admin Dashboard**: A dedicated dashboard for administrators to manage the platform.
- **Submission Review System**: Admins can view, approve, or reject pending business submissions. Approved businesses are automatically copied to the main `businesses` table.

### 4. **Technical Excellence & PWA**
- **Global Navigation**: A comprehensive, PWA-ready navigation system with a global top bar and a responsive sidebar, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **State Management**: Robust client-side state management that correctly handles authentication state changes, providing a seamless login/logout experience.
- **Code Quality**: Addressed and fixed numerous technical issues, including TypeScript errors, Next.js runtime errors, and file encoding problems, leading to a stable and reliable codebase.
- **PWA Ready**: The application is configured as a Progressive Web App with a service worker and manifest file, allowing it to be installed on desktop and mobile devices for an app-like experience.
