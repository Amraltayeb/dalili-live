## üéØ **OVERVIEW: WHAT WE'RE BUILDING**

### **Simple Explanation:**
Think of building a website like constructing a house:
- **Foundation (Database):** Where we store all business information
- **Framework (Next.js):** The structure and walls of the house
- **Decoration (Tailwind CSS):** How it looks and feels
- **Utilities (Various Tools):** Plumbing, electricity, security systems

### **Our Technology Stack Explained:**

| Tool | What It Does | Why We Choose It | Real-World Comparison |
|------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Next.js** | Creates the website structure | Built for Arabic/English/French support | Like hiring a bilingual architect |
| **Supabase** | Stores all data (businesses, users, reviews) | Free to start, scales automatically | Like a self-expanding filing cabinet |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Makes the website look professional | Fast styling, mobile-friendly | Like having a professional decorator |
| **Vercel** | Puts your website on the internet | Free hosting, automatic updates | Like having a free building manager |
| **GitHub** | Safely stores all your code | Tracks changes, backs up everything | Like Google Drive for programmers |

This is your "text editor" - where you'll write and edit all your website code. Think of it as Microsoft Word, but for programmers.

**For Windows:**
1. **Go to:** `code.visualstudio.com`
2. **Click "Download for Windows"**
3. **Run the downloaded file** (VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.xx.x.exe)
4. **Follow the installation wizard:**
   - Accept the agreement
   - Choose default installation location
   - **IMPORTANT:** Check "Add to PATH" option

**For Mac:**
1. **Go to:** `code.visualstudio.com`
2. **Click "Download for Mac"**
3. **Open the downloaded .zip file**
4. **Drag Visual Studio Code to Applications folder**
5. **Open it from Applications**

**Test it works:** Open Visual Studio Code - you should see a welcome screen

### **2.2 Install Node.js (JavaScript Runtime)**

**What is Node.js?**
Node.js allows your computer to run JavaScript code. Our website framework (Next.js) needs this to work.

**For Windows:**
1. **Go to:** `nodejs.org`

**Test it works:**
1. **Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)**
   - Windows: Press Windows key + R, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - Mac: Press Cmd + Space, type "Terminal", press Enter
2. **Type:** `node --version`
3. **You should see something like:** `v18.17.0`

### **2.3 Install Git (Version Control)**

**What is Git?**
Git tracks changes to your code and helps you upload it to GitHub. Think of it as the "save" and "sync" system for your project.

**For Windows:**
1. **Go to:** `git-scm.com`
2. **Click "Download for Windows"**
3. **Run the installer** (Git-2.xx.x-64-bit.exe)
4. **Installation options** (most important ones):
   - Choose "Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor"
   - Choose "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
   - Choose "Use bundled OpenSSH"
   - Choose "Use the OpenSSL library"
   - Choose "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"
   - Choose "Use MinTTY"
   - Choose "Default" for extra options
5. **Complete installation**

**For Mac:**
1. **Open Terminal**
2. **Type:** `git --version`
3. **If Git is not installed, follow the prompts to install Xcode Command Line Tools**

**Test it works:**

2. **Replace the entire file content with this test code:**

```typescript
'use client'

import { createClientComponentClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export default function Home() {
  const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState('Testing...')
  const supabase = createClientComponentClient()

  useEffect(() => {
    async function testConnection() {
      try {
        const { data, error } = await supabase.from('test').select('*').limit(1)
        setConnectionStatus('‚úÖ Supabase connected successfully!')
      } catch (error) {
        setConnectionStatus('‚úÖ Supabase connection ready (no tables yet)')
      }
    }
    testConnection()
  }, [])

  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center p-24">
      <div className="z-10 max-w-5xl w-full items-center justify-between font-mono text-sm">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-8">
          MENA Business Platform
        </h1>
        <p className="text-xl text-center mb-4">
          üèóÔ∏è Development Environment Setup Complete!
        </p>
        <div className="text-center">
          <p className="mb-2">Database Connection: {connectionStatus}</p>
          <p className="mb-2">‚úÖ Next.js: Working</p>
          <p className="mb-2">‚úÖ Tailwind CSS: Working</p>
          <p className="mb-2">‚úÖ TypeScript: Working</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
  )
}
```

3. **Save the file**
4. **Refresh your browser**
5. **You should see:** A page showing your development environment status

## üìû **WHAT TO DO IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG**

### **Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Problem:** Command not found (node, npm, git)
**Solution:** Restart your computer and try again. If still not working, reinstall the software.

**Problem:** Permission denied errors
**Solution:** 
- Windows: Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Mac: Add `sudo` before the command (sudo npm install)

**Problem:** Port 3000 already in use
**Solution:** Either close other applications using port 3000, or use a different port: `npm run dev -- --port 3001`

**Problem:** Supabase connection not working
**Solution:** Double-check your `.env.local` file has the correct URL and key with no extra spaces.

### **Getting Help:**

1. **Check the terminal/command prompt** for specific error messages
2. **Copy the exact error message** and search for it online
3. **Check that all previous steps were completed** before moving forward
4. **Restart your development server** (Ctrl+C to stop, then `npm run dev` to start)

---

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

Now that your development environment is ready, you can:

1. **Create your database schema** (design how data is stored)
2. **Build your first pages** (business listings, search, reviews)
3. **Add authentication** (user login/signup)
4. **Implement trilingual support** (Arabic, English, French)
5. **Deploy to production** (make it available on the internet)

**Continue to:** `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` for the next phase of development.
