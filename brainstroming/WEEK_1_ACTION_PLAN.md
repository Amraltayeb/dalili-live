## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **BY END OF WEEK 1:**
- [ ] Working database connection
- [ ] Admin panel to add ANY business type
- [ ] Public page showing business list
- [ ] 20 real businesses added (mix of all types)
- [ ] Platform works on mobile
- [ ] At least 1 person (not you) has browsed it

### **MINIMUM VIABLE SUCCESS:**
If you have just 10 businesses and a working platform, that's SUCCESS!
Better to have 10 working listings than 50 broken ones.
